# Cancer Cell Class Prediction

## Overview  
This project implements a **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** model to classify cancer cells based on a dataset of cell samples. The goal is to provide an accurate classification system to distinguish between malignant and benign cells, achieving a **99% accuracy rate**.

## Features  
- **High Accuracy:** The model achieves a high classification accuracy of 99%.  
- **Machine Learning Algorithm:** Uses the SVM algorithm for robust classification.  
- **Interactive Notebook:** The project is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook for easy experimentation and visualization.  
- **Public Dataset:** Utilizes a publicly available dataset for training and evaluation.  

## Dataset  
The dataset used in this project is available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sam1o1/cell-samplescsv). It contains labeled samples of cell data, which are used to train and test the model.
